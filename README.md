# JavaScript Function Bug: Handling Null and Undefined Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to handling null and undefined values within a function. The original `foo` function only explicitly checks for `null` values and doesn't account for `undefined`. This leads to unexpected behavior when undefined values are passed as arguments.

## Bug Description:
The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers. However, if either of the input arguments (`a` or `b`) is `undefined`, the function throws a `TypeError` instead of returning `null` or handling the situation gracefully.

## Solution:
The solution involves modifying the function to explicitly check for both `null` and `undefined` values. This ensures that the function handles both cases appropriately and avoids unexpected errors.

## How to reproduce the bug:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and run the code in a JavaScript environment.
3. Observe the error when passing `undefined` values to the `foo` function.

## How to run the solution:
1. Open `bugSolution.js` and run the code in a JavaScript environment.
2. Observe that the improved function now correctly handles both `null` and `undefined` values, returning `null` in such cases.
